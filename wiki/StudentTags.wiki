Student tags are labels for students in a specific course; tags are always associated with a student and a course, and not just a student alone.

Teachers can create their own tags such as:

  * DidNotWriteMidterm
  * DidNowWriteFinal
  * StartedCourseLate
  * Asn1MarkWeightChanged
  * ClearPassRuleApplied
