Teachers create and mark activities, while students "do" the activities.

Two major activity types are exams and assignments. There may be others, such as "participation marks".

Activities have:

  * A name.
  * A description.
  * A course that it is associated with.
  * A due date. Due dates depend on course offerings, and so they are not intrinsic features of an assignment. The due date is not necessarily known at the time the activity is created! Plus due dates can sometimes change after they are set. 
  * Assessment related information such as:
    * How many marks it is out of; this might depend on the course offering, so, like the due date, this is not an intrinsic feature of an activity.
    * What its weight is in the overall course marking scheme; this might depend on the course offering, so, like the due date, this is not an intrinsic feature of an activity.
  * Tags. These are strings associated with assignments meant to help categorize them.
