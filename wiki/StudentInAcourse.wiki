When a student is enrolled in a course, a special StudentInaCourse record is created for them to store course-specific information such as:

- The date they were added to the course (might be useful knowledge if they started late).
- The date they dropped the course (if indeed they did drop the course).
- Course-specific comments from the instructor/TA.
- Course-specific labels.
