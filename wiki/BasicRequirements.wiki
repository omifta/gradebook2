See also MajorPages for a list of the main pages expected to be in the system.

==Teacher Features==

  * Teacher view with easy to use "dashboard" collecting all important options. Allow control over when marks, assignments, graphs, etc. are visible.
  * Allow marks for an assignment or a course to be frozen to prevent markers from adding any more marks. This is not a security feature: it is just a convenience to help prevent changing marks after they have been officially submitted. Thus, any teacher for the course can unlock the lock.
  * Protect marks from overwriting due to overlapping writes. This is occasionally an issue in large course when multiple teachers are entering marks.
  * Import classic GB CSV files.
  * Record who marked what assignments. This way students can more quickly talk to the marker for their assignments.
  * Allow changes to the marking scheme for a single student. For example, a student misses an assignment, and the weight of the assignment is added to their midterm exam. All other students keep the same weighting.
  * Support team marks, including secure access for team members to view their team marks.
  * Provide an API for alternative marking schemes and reports.

==Student Features==
  * Student view with courses and preferences "dashboard".
  * Automatic email/RSS notices to students when marks have been changed, or assignments are added, etc.
  * Simple what-if analysis to answers questions like "What % must I get on the final exam to get an overall grade of 86% or higher".
  * Provide charts showing where student stands with respect to the rest of the class.

==General Features==
  * CSS for all pages.
  * Use JavaScript when appropriate.
