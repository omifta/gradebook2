#labels Phase-Requirements
See also MajorPages for a list of the main pages expected to be in the system.

==Actors==

  * TeacherUser (possibly TAs too, but it's unclear if making such a fine distinction is worth the trouble).
  * StudentUser.
  * AdminUser (e.g. responsible for adding students, etc.)
  * VisitorUser (i.e. people who want a tour of the GradeBook).

==Teacher Features==

  * Teacher view with easy to use "dashboard" collecting all important options. 
    * Add/remove/edit activities. Activities have names, descriptions, marks, weightings, tags, etc. (Should users be allowed to associate arbitrary objects with activities?)
    * Browse and search student records in a course.
    * Set page/report visibility. For instance, you might not want to let students see their marks on some activity that might be scaled. Or you might not want to let them see statistics of the overall class performance.
    * Restrict data changes by providing locks. When a course is done, no more changes should be made to the GB to avoid the problem that the instructor does not notice the changes. These locks are not meant to be super-secure security features: they are just there to prevent the problem of a marker changing a marker after the instructor has downloaded all the marks.
  * Protect marks from overwriting due to overlapping writes. This is occasionally an issue in large course when multiple teachers are entering marks.
  * Import classic GB CSV files.
  * Record who marked what assignments. This way students can more quickly talk to the marker for their assignments.
  * Allow changes to the marking scheme for a single student. For example, a student misses an assignment, and the weight of the assignment is added to their midterm exam. All other students keep the same weighting.
  * Provide an API for alternative marking schemes and reports.
  * Teachers can apply "tags" to students, such as "didNotWriteFinal" (which could be added automatically), or to help track teams, e.g. all the team members on Team LimePress could be tagged with "LimePress". Searching and sorting by tags would also be useful.
  * Enable random order of displays, which would be useful for choosing orders for presentations, etc.

==Student Features==
  * Student view with courses and preferences "dashboard".
  * Automatic email/RSS notices to students when marks have been changed, or assignments are added, etc.
  * Simple what-if analysis to answers questions like "What % must I get on the final exam to get an overall grade of 86% or higher".
  * Provide charts showing where student stands with respect to the rest of the class.

==General Features==
  * CSS for all pages.
  * Use JavaScript when appropriate.
